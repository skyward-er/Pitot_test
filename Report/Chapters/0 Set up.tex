\section{Test conditions}

The test were executed in the afternoon in a hot day, the tests have been done in a short period
of time so the atmospheric conditions are almost the same. The wind tunnel has recorded all the
atmospheric data with an high precision, this remove every possible problem given by the atmospheric
conditions.\\
In the next table are reported the mean values of every atmospheric for the tests.\\

Here the conditions are valued as nominal or not fit for the test considering the test itself and the flight conditions. Everything must be explained
